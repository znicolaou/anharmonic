# Files in the anharmonic repository
The file pendula.py is a python script to numerically integrate the anharmonic time crystal pendulum model oscillator networks using SciPy's Complex-valued Variable-coefficient Ordinary Differential Equation solver.  The file plot.nb is a Mathematica notebook which can be used to plot results.  The folder data contains the output generated by the examples below.
# System requirements
This python code has been run with anaconda2 and anaconda3, either of which can be downloaded from the Anaconda website: https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos.  It requires packages numpy, scipy, and progressbar. Create an environment with these packages with `conda create -n anharmonic_env scipy numpy progressbar` and activate it with `source activate anharmonic_env`.  The Mathematica code has been run with Mathematica 11.1.1.0.
# Usage
Running the terminal command `./pendula.py -h` will give a usage message with command line argument descriptions.

# Output files
The program will produce two output files, filebaseout.dat and filebasedat.npy. The file filebaseout.dat is a text file containing a single line with the number of pendulum, the driving frequency, the driving amplitude, the output timestep, the damping coefficient, the noise intensity, the random length intensity, the number of cycles run, the random seed, and the number of steps between noise samples. The file filebasedat.npy is a binary file containing the angles for the pendula at each timestep.
